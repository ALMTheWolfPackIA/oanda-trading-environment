Deploying the OANDA Trading Environment using Ansible
=====================================================

Requires Ansible (developed with 1.9.3, guess numerous lower versions will do)

This Ansible code is developed for Raspbian_wheezy but is also tested
on Debian 7.7. It is likely that it runs on other Debian / Ubuntu flavours also.
