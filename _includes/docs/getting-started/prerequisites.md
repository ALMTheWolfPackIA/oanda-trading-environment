# Prerequisites

Before installing the OANDA Trading Enviroment you need to have:

* a `token` to use the OANDA REST-API. So please check for that at [developer.oanda.com](https://developer.oanda.com). Tokens are needed to access the **practice** account aswell as the **live** environment.
* an `account_id`, check the OANDA-webinterface for that after you've registered, or when you have the token you could create/list the accounts for your token.

The account_id is needed to configure the OANDAd daemon to get streaming quotes.
