# Security

The environment makes use of a token that gives access to sensitive information.

Please pay attention to where you install this software. **Never** use this on
a system that is not owned and controlled by yourself.

Make sure to secure your system as much as possible:

* restrict network access
* make no use of, or limit other network services (NFS, SAMBA, printerserver etc.)
* limit or deny user access, preferrable only you
* use encryption to access the system (SSH)
* how is physical access ?
